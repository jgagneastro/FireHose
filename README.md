# FireHose
A modified version of the Firehose IDL pipeline to reduce data obtained with the Folded-port InfraRed Echellette (FIRE) near-infrared spectrograph described here : http://web.mit.edu/~rsimcoe/www/FIRE/

Please note that I am not the original author of this reduction package, which was created by Robert Simcoe

Please refer to /FireHose/1-Firehose/Documentation/ECHELLETTE_README.txt to reduce Echelle data with firehose.pro
or to /FireHose/1-Firehose/Documentation/PRISM_README.txt to reduce Prism data with firehose_ld.pro
